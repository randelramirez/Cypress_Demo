  save-partial-coverage-report:
    description: |
      Saves a single possibly partial coverage report by adding it to the
      workspace. This way different CircleCI jobs can run parts of the tests
      and save their results to be merged later.
    parameters:
      coverage-filename:
        type: string
        default: coverage/coverage-final.json
        description: |
          Path to the final coverage JSON file produced by "nyc" tool.
          Typically called "coverage/coverage-final.json"

          Human name for the coverage file. For example, when saving both Cypress
          and Jest coverage file, use "cypress" and "jest" to have distinct filenames.
